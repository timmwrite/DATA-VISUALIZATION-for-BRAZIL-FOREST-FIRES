Fires are a serious problem in Brazil. As stated under the Dataset description, "Understanding the frequency of forest fires in a time series can help to take action to prevent them". Being able to pin-point where and when that frequency is most observed should give some clarity on what is the scope we are looking at.With this data, it is possible to assess the evolution of fires over the years as well as the regions where they were concentrated. The legal Amazon comprises the states of Acre, Amapá, Pará, Amazonas, Rondonia, Roraima, and part of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, and Maranhão.
